## Introduction

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React.js. I originally created this game as part of a Jump Start weekend before enrolling in LEARN Academy. Since then, I've revamped the game to leverage React for better state management and dynamic cell updates.

## Features

- Clickable squares: Test your luck by clicking any square on the board.
- Win & Lose Conditions: Discover the treasure to win or fail and try again!
  
## Technologies

- React.js
- Yarn

## Installation

To run this game locally, you'll need Yarn. If you don't have it, install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew install yarn
```

Then, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will install all dependencies and fire up the development server.

## How to Play

Play by yourself, or with a friend, try to get three in a row!

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests for any enhancements, bug fixes, or other contributions.
