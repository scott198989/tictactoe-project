## Introduction

This is a tic-tac-toe game I made using React.js.  I originally made this game during Jump Start weekend before I enrolled in LEARN Academy, since then I went and re-worked the program and added React to handle state and the updating of the cells.

## Features

You can click a square, any square, and try to find the treasure.  If found, you win the game and can start over.  And there is a losing condition as well.

## Dependencies

If using homebrew:

brew update

brew install yarn

yarn start
